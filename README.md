## Font Properties with AddressOf


</div>

### Description

This is a demo of how to use AddressOf to obtain information about font families. Unfortunately AddressOf cannot work from classes so it isn't exactly what I needed but it is useful. You can quickly fill a listbox or collection with font names meeting specific conditions. Some FontTypes are not on my system so while I built a detector for them I cannot be sure they work. Comments and votes welcome.

Feel free to use all or parts of this but leave copyrights in place and let me know about it at
